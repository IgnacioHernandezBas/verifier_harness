# 🎯 Scaling Your Pipeline - Complete Solution

## Overview

You asked: **"How can I test more samples and repositories?"**

**Answer:** You now have **3 approaches** to scale your integrated pipeline:

---

## ✅ Approach 1: Python Batch Script (Simple)

**File:** `batch_integrated_pipeline.py` (not created yet - you cancelled it)

**When to use:**
- Running on a single machine
- Want sequential or basic parallel processing
- Don't need SLURM cluster features

**How to use:**
```bash
python batch_integrated_pipeline.py --repo "scikit-learn/scikit-learn" --limit 20
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, easy to understand
- No SLURM knowledge needed
- Good for small batches (5-20 instances)

**Cons:**
- No cluster parallelism
- Must manage storage manually
- Slower for large batches

---

## ✅ Approach 2: SLURM Cluster (Recommended for Large Scale) 🚀

**Files created:**
- `slurm_integrated_pipeline.sh` - Main SLURM batch script
- `slurm_worker_integrated.py` - Worker for single instance
- `submit_integrated_batch.py` - Smart submission helper
- `slurm_cleanup_cache.py` - Storage management

**When to use:**
- Need to process many instances (20-100+)
- Want parallel execution across cluster nodes
- Testing multiple repositories
- **This is what you should use for production**

**How to use:**
```bash
# Quick start
python submit_integrated_batch.py --repo "scikit-learn/scikit-learn" --limit 10 --max-parallel 3

# Check before running
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 50 --dry-run

# Multi-repo batch
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 100 --max-parallel 5
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Parallel execution (3-10 jobs at once)
- ✅ Automatic storage management
- ✅ Container reuse across jobs
- ✅ Can process hundreds of instances
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and cleanup tools

**Cons:**
- Requires SLURM cluster access
- Storage is still limited (23 GB = ~19 containers)

---

## ✅ Approach 3: Notebook → Script Conversion

**Existing:** `integrated_pipeline_modular.ipynb`

**Convert to script:**
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script integrated_pipeline_modular.ipynb
# Then wrap in a loop for multiple instances
```

**When to use:**
- Quick experimentation
- One-off testing
- Interactive development

---

## 🎯 Recommendation: Use SLURM Cluster Approach

Based on your requirements, **Approach 2 (SLURM)** is best because:

1. **You have cluster access** (scavenger partition)
2. **Storage is managed** automatically
3. **Scales to 100+ instances** with batching
4. **Container reuse** means less storage needed
5. **All modules work** (Static + Fuzzing + Rules)

---

## 📊 Storage: The Real Constraint

You're right to worry about storage! Here's the reality:

### Current Situation
```
Free space: 23 GB
Current cache: 1.3 GB (1 container)
Container size: ~1.2 GB each
Maximum containers: ~19 (before running out)
```

### The Problem
- Each SWE-bench instance **may** need a unique container
- 100 instances = potentially 100 containers = **120 GB needed** ❌

### The Solution ✅

**1. Container Reuse**
- Multiple instances from the **same repo** share the same container
- Example: 10 scikit-learn instances = **1 container** (1.2 GB)

**2. Smart Cleanup** (automated in submission script)
```bash
# Automatic warning when space is low
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 50  # checks storage first

# Manual cleanup between batches
python slurm_cleanup_cache.py --keep-recent 10
```

**3. Staged Batches**
```bash
# Process in chunks with cleanup between
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 50 --max-parallel 5
# Wait for completion, then cleanup
python slurm_cleanup_cache.py --keep-recent 5

# Next batch
python submit_integrated_batch.py --skip 50 --limit 50 --max-parallel 5
```

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Testing Multiple Repos

### Step 1: Start Small (Verify Everything Works)

```bash
# Test with 5 instances
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 5 --max-parallel 2

# Monitor
squeue -u $USER
tail -f logs/pipeline_*.out

# Check results
ls results/
```

**Expected time:** ~20 hours (5 × 4 hours)
**Expected storage:** ~6 GB (5 × 1.2 GB if all unique)

---

### Step 2: Medium Batch (20 instances)

```bash
# Check storage first
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 20 --dry-run

# Submit if OK
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 20 --max-parallel 5

# Monitor storage
watch -n 300 'python slurm_cleanup_cache.py --status'
```

**Expected time:** ~16 hours (20 instances, 5 parallel)
**Expected storage:** ~20-24 GB (may hit limit!)

---

### Step 3: Large Scale (100+ instances)

**Strategy: Staged batches with cleanup**

```bash
# Batch 1: First 50
python submit_integrated_batch.py --limit 50 --max-parallel 5
# Wait for completion (~40 hours)

# Cleanup (keep only 5 most recent)
python slurm_cleanup_cache.py --keep-recent 5

# Batch 2: Next 50
python submit_integrated_batch.py --skip 50 --limit 50 --max-parallel 5

# Repeat as needed...
```

## 🎛️ Module Control for Speed

**Full pipeline is slow (3-4 hours per instance).** Speed it up by disabling modules:

### Static Only (Super Fast)
```bash
python submit_integrated_batch.py \
    --limit 100 \
    --disable-fuzzing \
    --disable-rules \
    --max-parallel 15
```
**Time:** ~100 minutes (100 × 1 min)

### Fuzzing + Rules (Skip Static)
```bash
python submit_integrated_batch.py \
    --limit 50 \
    --disable-static \
    --max-parallel 5
```
**Time:** Still ~200 hours, but no static overhead
